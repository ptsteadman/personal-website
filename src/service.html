        <h4>Food Tragedy</h4>
        <p>
        i was feeling really sick and also really didn't want
        to see greek restaurant guy because i felt embarrassed about being too
        forward with him over the weekend.
        (weekend + week are really differentiated for
        us) 
        <br><br>
        so i sat in the car while my coworkers went in and ordered me food. i
        almost fell asleep in the car covering face w sleeve. i had my assistant get me
        the same thing i usually get, which is beans, and these special fries they
        have.i like the beans because it's just red onion, bean, cilantro(?),
        and olive oil & spices. tastes very "fresh"
        olive oil & spices. tastes very "fresh"
        <br><br>

        in the past when i've gone there i've over-ordered almost every time
        because im too embarrassed to only order potatoes (fries + greek potatoes) so
        i'll get a pita and never finish it and save it for bites over the next couple
        days, never finishing it. now i'm wondering how a punk guy like him thinks of
        me ordering 18 bucks worth of food, kombucha, and tip

        <h4>Class Differences</h4>
        <p><i>Class differences</i> have a lot of romantic promise, but the reality is
        often a disappointment.<br>
        <i>Class differences</i> get you laid a lot less than you'd expect. <br>
        <i>Class differences</i> help us forget that we're all the same.<br>
        <i>Class differences</i> allow for fairy tales.<br>
        <i>Class differences</i> allow us to feel like we're coming from
        somewhere, going somewhere.<br><br>
        What happens to the service aesthetic if you live in a neoliberal
        "paradise"?  What happens when the person who sells you
        your coffee is not naive, but a full market participant with agency, a
        food service owner and entrepreneur?

        I always know where to find her.  She is not a moving target, unlike my college
        and professional peers. 
        <br><br>

        It's 2015, can you believe this still turns us on?
        <br>
        Can you believe this is still pruient?

        <h4>Retail Tragedy</h4>
        <p>she was working at [redacted high end retail shore on melrose] when
        she met [redacted], the italian heir to [redacted italian automobile company].
        they exchanged numbers and emails. he said, "you shouldn't be working here.
        what do you want to do?" she said, "i want to be a writer."
        <br><br>
        he told her he could get her work at italian vogue. was she wiling to move to
        new york. of course she was. he emailed the editor-in-chief of italian vogue's
        assistant to connect them through email. over the course of a few weeks, they
        asked her for a writing sample. she had not written in years. she quickly
        penned a few short articles and spent the entire day editing. one piece was
        about '90s fashion. she titled it "the '90s are back and All That" or something
        like that. she sent it to her friend and he gave his critique, but she was sure
        it
