        someday I will care only for<br>
        the boy attracted to gardens<br>
        and embarrassed when caught<br>
        who is happy with his thin<br>
        arms and legs being tickled<br>
        by grass, alone<br><br>

        I was always afraid,<br>
        but also fully capable of<br>
        brutality, of being the one<br>
        who smashed the fish open<br>
        when the hook wouldn't<br> 
        come out<br><br>

        there may be no meaning<br>
        in my blonde legs splattered<br>
        with foul-smelling blood<br><br>
        I don't trust my childhood;<br><br>

        What are we doing here<br>
        on this body of water<br>
        we are learning to compete<br> 
        to become superior<br><br>

        surely the bitterness of death<br>
        has passed and we don't need<br>
        to do this, I have nothing left<br>
        satisfy my pride and I will be<br>
        happy and never row again<br>
        victory is forever<br><br>

        as a boy I never dreamed<br>
        I would suffer like this<br> 
        with the sunlight in the tears<br>
        in my eyes my body crying<br>
        because it's a bitch I thought<br>
        it would all be very easy<br><br>
        </p>

        <p>//</p>

                <p>
        He told me I should exercise<br>
        I don't know what to do<br>
        How could someone say that<br>
        I don't know what to do but cry<br><br>

        It all makes so much sense now<br>
        Why I haven't had a true relationship<br>
        Why I felt no one would love me<br>
        Because I'm fat.<br>
        I'm fatter than I thought<br>
        I'm fat and I'm ugly.<br>
        I'm a horrible person.<br><br>

        I just want to die<br><br>
        </p>
       
	<p>^ that is not my writing</p><br><br>

        "don't write on this table it's unfinished wood,"<br>
        says the thirty-three year old to his<br>
        twenty-two year old girlfriend<br><br>

        she leaves his place and thinks about<br>
        unfinished wood tables for the first time<br><br>

        at what age do people learn about<br>
        the tables that cost $3000, she wonders<br><br>

        to fix their life with <br>
        that kind of beauty<br>
                </p>
