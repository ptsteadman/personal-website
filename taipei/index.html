<h1>Taipei New Life Road</h1>

<p>The first time I went out to take pictures in Taipei, I tried to photograph a
woman with a disfigured eye who was selling flowers on the street.  This seemed
like the kind of documentary photography I admired and wanted to produce.  The
woman raised her hand to cover her face, and I knew instantly that I was too
much of a ~pussy~ to photograph other people.</p>

<p>But the DSLR camera I had asked my grandparents for was exensive, so I took
pictures of other things.  Growing up in Buffalo, New York, I was surrounded by
abandoned buildings, and some of my beautiful memories of high school involved
exploring these factories, theaters, hospitals, train stations, and offices.</p>
<p>In Buffalo, buildings were truly abandonded: no one owned them, or wanted to
own them.  In Taipei, there were a large number of vacant buildings, but most of
them were only in limbo, in the process of being destroyed and redeveloped.
</p>
<p>I enjoyed climbing into self-contained housing projects that were about to be
demolished.  These postwar structures had their own internal streets and
breezeways, and seemed to reflect the more idealistic ambitions of the Republic
of China in the early 60s.  The apartments were usually filled with whatever the
families had left behind.  Wall calendars were stopped at 2003, 2007, 2009.</p>

<p>The family portraits left behind were striking.</p>
<img src="img/art2.jpg">
<p>I was hardly the only person to realize the fraught nature of some of these
buildings.  I often stumbled on quite elaborate art projects and graffiti, the
best of which I don't have pictures of: an old medical facility in which every
room was a little art project.  It was a random and delightful find, a credit to
art college nearby.</p>

<p>During the first half of my year as an exchange student in Taiwan, I sort of
enjoyed the isolation that the language barrier provided.  My distate for
mangaling the Chinese language gave me an excuse to simply spend most of my time
wandering alone, looking for "things", or going over vocabularly and
pronounciation with my doting host mother.  I think it was time well-spent,
honestly.  </p>

<p>Sometimes I'd explore with other exchange students.  One time, I convinced
one of the French students to break away from the group to check out a
half-finished seaside resort.  What would have been a massive glass-enclosed
lobby was only a skeleton of steel beams, allowing the sound of waves to fill
the echoing space.  Other parts of the building were almost complete: some
bedrooms were decorated with plastic flowers; some doors and hallways opened to
six story drops.  As we walked back along the beach, the French exchange student
told me how attractive she found my normal exploration partner, another American
student.</p>

<p>The process of writing college applications and being admitted harmed my
mental health.  As my time in Taiwan drew to a close, my explorations became
more compulsive and subterranean.</p>

<p>My biggest project was exploring a network of drainage tunnels I found under
a a "cultural park".  After some exploration, I realized that the tunnels led to
a five mile long underground river that cut under the center of Taipei.  I
planned to buy an inflatable kayak and the paddle the length of the river.</p>
<img src="img/portal.jpg">
<p>One of the more stressful aspects of this exploration was that the entrance
to the tunnels was an access hatch in a busy public park.  Young couples often
were sitting in the grass around the hatch, taking pictures of their children.</p>

<p>This exploration was done alone.  I haven't looked at these pictures in
almost five years, and I wonder if I'd still enjoy an exploration like this.
Those are red cockroaches on the wall.  As an adult, if I really love
drainage systems or factories, it is within my power to get a Masters of
Engineering and work in these things for a living.</p>

<p>One time, when I was walking down a narrow passageway, I
realized there was another light coming towards me.  At first, I thought it
might be own flashlight reflecting off something.  I turned my light off, and
could see a person moving at the far end of the hallway.  I think he was
shouting at me, but I couldn't tell what he was saying to the sound of water.</p>
<p>I felt intense dread.  Was this the police, down here looking for me?  Had I made
a terrible mistake?  What would my parents say?  No one knew I was down in the
tunnels.</p>
<p>Ending the standoff,  I turned around and quickly walked away. (But not
before I took a picture.)</p>

<p>I ate
McDonalds after a successful exploration.  Living in Taiwan made me really
appreciate McDonalds, where I could go even if drenched in drainage water, eat a
Big Mac,  and listen to young Taiwanese businesspeople discuss their
plans.</p>
<p>I stopped doing these explorations a few years ago.  Why?   In Taiwan, and in
Buffalo, I got caught a few times, but it was never a big deal. </p>

<p> I think I'm mostly afraid of the embarassment of being an adult caught doing
childish things.</p>
