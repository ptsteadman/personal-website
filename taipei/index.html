<p>The first time I went out to take pictures in Taipei, I tried to photograph
a woman with a disfigured eye who was selling flowers on the street.  This
seemed like the kind of documentary photography I wanted to produce
with my new DSLR.  The woman raised her hand to cover her face, and I knew
instantly that I was too much of a "pussy" to photograph other people.</p>

<p>Growing up in Buffalo, New York, I was surrounded by abandoned buildings,
and some of my beautiful memories of high school involved exploring these
factories, theaters, hospitals, train stations, offices, etc.</p> <p>In Buffalo,
buildings were truly abandonded: no one owned them, or wanted to own them.  In
Taipei, there were a large number of vacant postwar buildings, but most of them were
 in the process of being destroyed and redeveloped.
</p> 
<p>
These buildings had their own internal streets and breezeways, and seemed to
reflect the more idealistic ambitions of the Republic of China in the early
60s.  The apartments were usually filled with whatever the families had left
behind, and had wall calendars from 2003, 2007, and 2009.</p>

<p>The family portraits left behind were striking.</p>
<img src="img/art2.jpg">
<p>I was hardly the only person to realize the fraught nature of some of these
buildings.  I often stumbled on quite elaborate art projects and graffiti,
especially near arts colleges.</p>

<p>During the first half of my year as an exchange student in Taiwan, I sort of
enjoyed the isolation that the language barrier provided.  My distate for
mangling the Chinese language gave me an excuse to simply spend most of my time
wandering alone, looking for "things", or going over vocabularly and
pronounciation with my doting host mother.  I think it was time well-spent,
honestly.  </p>
<img src="img/aaron.jpg">
<p>Sometimes I'd explore things with other exchange students.  One time, I convinced
one of the French students to break away from the group to check out a
half-finished seaside resort.  What would have been a massive glass-enclosed
lobby was only steel beams, allowing the sound of waves to fill
the echoing space.  Other parts of the building were almost complete: some
bedrooms were decorated with plastic flowers; some doors and hallways opened to
six story drops.  As we walked back along the beach, the French exchange student
told me how attractive she found my normal exploration partner, another American
student.</p>

<p>The process of writing college applications harmed my mental health.  As my
time in Taiwan drew to a close, my explorations became more compulsive and
subterranean.</p>

<p>My biggest project was exploring a network of drainage tunnels I found under
a a "cultural park".  After some exploration, I realized that the tunnels led to
a five mile long underground river that cut under the center of Taipei.  I
planned to buy an inflatable kayak and the paddle the length of the river.</p>
<img src="img/portal.jpg">
<p>One of the more stressful aspects of this exploration was that the entrance
to the tunnels was an access hatch in a busy public park.  Young couples often
were sitting in the grass around the hatch, taking pictures of their children.</p>

<p>I haven't looked at these pictures in almost five years, and I wonder if I'd
still enjoy an exploration like this.  Would the red cockroaches covering the
walls be more of a dealbreaker?   As an adult, if I really love drainage systems
or factories, I can get a Masters of Engineering and work in them for
a living.</p>

<p>One time, when I was walking down a narrow passageway, I
realized there was another light coming towards me. I thought it
might be own flashlight reflecting off something.  I turned my light off, and
could see a person moving at the far end of the hallway.  I think he was
shouting at me, but I couldn't tell what he was saying due to the sound of water.</p>
<p>I felt intense dread.  Was this the police, down here looking for me?  Had I made
a terrible mistake?  What would my parents say?  No one knew I was down in the
tunnels.</p>
<p>Ending the standoff,  I turned around and quickly walked away. (But not
before I took a picture.)</p>
<img src="img/mcd.jpg">
<p>After a successful exploration, I usually ate McDonalds.  Living in Taiwan
made me really appreciate McDonalds, where I could go even if drenched in
drainage water, eat a Big Mac, and listen to young Taiwanese businesspeople
discuss their plans.</p>
<p>I stopped doing these explorations a few years ago.  Why?   In Taiwan, and in
Buffalo, I got caught a few times, but it was never a big deal. </p>

<p> I think I'm mostly afraid of the embarassment of being an adult caught doing
childish things.</p>
